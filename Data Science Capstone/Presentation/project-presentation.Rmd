## Building A Predictive Text Algorithm

This presentation is for the Data Science Specialization Capstone that Johns Hopkins University offers in Coursera.

The course instructors have gave us a curated dataset that Swiftkey, a company that provides text prediction technology, gently provided. It contains data from Twitter, blogs and news sites.

The goal is to create an algorithm for predicting the next word given one or more words (a phrase/sentence) as input. A large corpus of more than 4 million documents was loaded, sampled, tokenized and analyzed. N-grams (1 to 4) were extracted from the corpus and then used for building the predictive model.

## How Have I Made It

Using R packages such as `tidyr`, `dplyr`, `tidytext`, `stringr`, `stringi`, `tm`, `RWeka`, I've loaded the data, created a sample of 20% of it, converted it to a corpus of documents, cleaned and prepared it to be used in the web app. 

During cleaning, the data was converted to lower case, removed punctuation, links, emails, non alphanumeric characters, excessive whitespace, numbers and profanity words.

After that, I've tokenized the documents in the corpus and builded N-Gram Models (unigram, bigram, trigram and quadgrams) with stopwords in the form of 'tibbles', a easy to use form of table, that functions as a sorted frequency dictionary. Then abandon the least frequent words (the long tail), say the ones that only cover 10% of occurrences or the ones that only appear once in the text corpus. After that, I've saved those tables as .RDS Files that later the web app reads.

## About The Web Application

The application uses the Shiny framework and provides a text input box for the user to type a desired phrase. It allows you to predict your next word in a sentence after you are done typing and clicked submit. 

This function can help you to figure out a suitable word to use: for the current typing word if the algorithm detects that you haven't done typing it or a next possible word if detects a whitespace or a complete word. 

It could take some few seconds to load before starting to get suggestions.

The web app also comes with a tab with instructions and another about the author and related links.

## How The Algorithm Works

The algorithm developed to predict the next word in a user-entered text string was based on a classic N-gram model and allows to configure how many words the app should suggest.

I've created various frequency dictionaries according to the n-grams, and the algorithm references them when the user types in a word, phrase, or sentence. 

The algorithm first takes the last 3 words of the sentence and checks it against the 4-gram frequency table. If not present, then it backs off to check the next lower n-gram frequency dictionary. If doesn't find a suitable match at the bigram, it returns 'NO PREDICTIONS'

Also, if the algorithm detects that the user haven't finished typing a word after clicking the 'Submit' button, it suggest possible words.
